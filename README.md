# Tyrrell County Website Redesign

Welcome to the source code for the redesigned [Tyrrell County, North Carolina](https://tyrrellcounty.org/) website.

## 🌐 Overview

This project is a modern, responsive, and accessible redesign of the Tyrrell County website, built with:

- **HTML5**: Semantic, accessible markup for all pages
- **Bootstrap 5**: For grid, navigation, and responsive layouts
- **Bootstrap Icons**: Consistent, lightweight iconography
- **Custom CSS**: For branding and dark/light mode support
- **JavaScript**: For dark mode toggle, back-to-top button, and accessibility enhancements

## 🚀 Features

- **Mobile-first, fully responsive design**
- **Dark/Light mode toggle** (remembers user preference)
- **Accessible navigation** (skip link, keyboard-friendly, ARIA roles)
- **Consistent header and footer on all pages**
- **"Back to Top" button**
- **Downloadable forms and public records**
- **Contact and department listings**
- **Social media sharing links**
- **Optimized for performance and modern browsers**

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone this repository**
2. Open `index.html` or any subpage in your browser (no build step required)
3. To view all features, ensure you have an internet connection for loading Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons via CDN

## 📸 Bottom Image on All Pages

To ensure the bottom photo section displays correctly (full width, curved top corners, shadow), **add this HTML block directly after your `</main>` tag and before `<footer>` on every subpage:**

```html
<section class="shadow-lg home-image-section" aria-label="Tyrrell County Offices in spring">
  <div class="home-image"></div>
</section>
```

- **Do not nest this section inside a `.container` or `.card`**. It must be outside so it appears full width, as on the home page.
